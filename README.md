# HOW TO USE:

`cat ciphertext | python3 choukim-source.py`

Pass the ciphertext to `python3 vinegar.py` and you should get a decrypted version out. For part 2, we have around 60%-70% confidence in full decryption, and sometimes it will result in around a 20% low-confidence partial decryption.

`generator.py` is taken from the Slack where the TAs shared it with us. It is slightly modified for our purposes.
